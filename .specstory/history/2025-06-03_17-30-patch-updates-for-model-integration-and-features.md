_**User**_

Please patch in the following:

<details><summary>Click to view exact diff-style edits</summary>



⸻

1 – Section 2. Quantization & Inference Engine

Locate the bullet list that ends with:

- **vLLM (PagedAttention runtime):** Flash-Attention-2 kernels ...

Immediately append:

- **Tabby ML self-hosted completion server:** Streams OpenAI-compatible completions from on-device or on-prem weights; serves as the default low-latency model pool for VS Code/Electron.  
- **Ollama model runner:** Manages local 4-bit GGUF/MLX builds (StarCoder-2, Llama-3-8B-Q4). Used by Tabby or directly via the CLI for quick single-model experiments.


⸻

2 – Section 3. AI/LLM Integration

After the first bullet (“Registry-Enabled Prompt Engineering: …”) insert:

- **Local-first model pool via Tabby ML + Ollama:** All runtime agents call Tabby first; RouterAdapter falls back to cloud models only when SLA or cost policies dictate.


⸻

3 – Section 4. Observability & Resilience

Just before the sub-heading **Chaos Engineering & Resilience Testing:**, add:

- **Keptn Remediation Controller:** Subscribes to Prometheus SLO alerts and triggers declarative `remediation.yaml` workflows (rollback, scale-up, config patch). Tightly integrated with Temporal workflows so ReflexionEngine can capture and audit every remediation step.


⸻

4 – Section 5. Developer Experience & Extensibility

Right after the first bullet (“Zero-Boilerplate CLI Scaffolding: …”) insert:

- **Continue IDE Chat & Roo Code Commands:** The VS Code extension embeds Continue for natural-language chat and slash-commands, while Roo Code provides autonomous multi-file “agent runs” (e.g., `/roo fix-tests`).  
- **Unified Refactor Preview Panel:** Powered by Roo Code’s diff UI and OpenRewrite AST visualiser, enabling safe apply/undo of large-scale edits.


⸻

5 – Section 9. Utility Services

Find the sentence:

Default local vector store is LanceDB …

Replace the entire sentence with:

Default local vector store is **Chroma** for embedded sqlite-kv ease; pipeline can fall back to **LanceDB** for edge/offline scenarios or **Weaviate** for clustered hybrid search (dense + BM25).


⸻

6 – Section 12. Observability & Feedback Loops

After the paragraph ending “… granular insight.” add:

- **Explainability Panel:** Inside both the VS Code extension and Electron app, a dedicated tab replays OpenTelemetry spans, chain-of-thought snippets, and agent decision graphs so users can audit and learn from every suggestion.


⸻

7 – Section 15. Proposed New Agents & Utilities

Immediately after the existing table row for RefactoringAgent, append three rows:

| **OpenRewriteService** | Executes language-specific recipes for large-scale code migrations (e.g., Java → 17, React → Server Components) with AST-level safety. |
| **SemgrepAutofixUtility** | Runs Semgrep’s AI Autofix engine to patch security findings automatically, gated by CriticAgent confidence thresholds. |
| **QualityAgent** | Aggregates Semgrep, OpenRewrite, test coverage, and CodeHotspot metrics to generate DORA dashboards and feed PlannerAgent task prioritisation. |


⸻

8 – Section 16.1 Hybrid Local/Cloud Model Routing

Replace the phrase:

“Integrations with Ollama CLI & Tabby ML provide sub-100 ms on-device completions …”

with:

Integrations with **Tabby ML** (primary) and **Ollama CLI** (direct model runner) provide sub-100 ms on-device completions…


⸻

9 – Section 20. AutoRL & Continuous Optimisation → 20.2 Continual Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

Prepend this sentence to the paragraph:

Local checkpoints are served by Tabby ML; models are first evaluated in a canary pool before promotion to default.


⸻


</details>


Apply these edits and the current spec will fully integrate the new model-pool, IDE, remediation, explainability and quality features—without losing any of the existing low-level detail.
