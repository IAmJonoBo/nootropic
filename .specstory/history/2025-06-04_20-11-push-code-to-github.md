```bash
git status
```

```
On branch main
Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged,
and have 1 and 30 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" if you want to integrate the remote branch with yours)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .specstory/history/2025-06-04_12-32-(1)-clarifying-project-i
mplementation-details.md
        modified:   pnpm-workspace.yaml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml
        .specstory/history/2025-06-04_20-11-untitled.md
        renovate.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

Your local branch has diverged from the remote `origin/main` (you have 1 local commit, and the remote has 30 commits you don't have). You also have:

- 2 modified files not staged for commit:
  - `.specstory/history/2025-06-04_12-32-(1)-clarifying-project-implementation-details.md`
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
- 3 untracked files:
  - `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`
  - `.specstory/history/2025-06-04_20-11-untitled.md`
  - `renovate.json`

Before pushing, you need to:
1. Add and commit your changes.
2. Pull and resolve any merge conflicts (since your branch has diverged).
3. Push to GitHub.

Would you like to:
- Commit all changes (including untracked files)?
- Only commit specific files?
- Proceed with a merge or rebase from the remote before pushing?

Let me know your preference, or I can proceed with the standard flow: add all, commit, pull (merge), and push.
