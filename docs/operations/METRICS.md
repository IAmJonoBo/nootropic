> **NOTE:** Nootropic is designed with a local-first, privacy-preserving, and data-sovereign philosophy. All metrics collection and analysis are performed locally by default. This guide focuses on essential metrics for solo developers and local development workflows.

This guide outlines the key metrics used to measure and monitor nootropic's performance, reliability, and user experience, with a focus on local collection, privacy, and practical insights for solo developers.
