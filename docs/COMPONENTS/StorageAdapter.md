# StorageAdapter

## Summary

The **StorageAdapter** provides a unified abstraction for persisting and retrieving diverse data artifacts—vector embeddings, documents, metadata, and binary blobs—across multiple storage backends. It encapsulates logic for choosing between Chroma (or LanceDB) for vector storage, Weaviate for hybrid search, MinIO for object storage, and relational databases (RDBMS) for structured metadata. By handling failover (e.g., when Chroma data size grows too large), latency thresholds, and consistency guarantees, the StorageAdapter ensures downstream agents (SearchAgent, MemoryAgent, CriticAgent) can read/write data reliably, even in high‐volume or degraded environments.

Key features include:

* Dynamic backend selection (Chroma → LanceDB) based on data volume
* Hybrid search backend fallback (Chroma → Weaviate) when recall drops
* Unified APIs for CRUD operations on embeddings, documents, and binary assets
* Health‐check endpoints and automatic retry on transient errors
* Pluggable configuration for local vs. containerized deployments

***

## 1. Responsibilities

1. **Unified Persistence Layer**

   * Expose a single interface (`storeEmbedding`, `queryVectors`, `storeDocument`, `fetchDocument`, `storeBlob`, `fetchBlob`, etc.) that internally routes requests to the appropriate backend (Chroma, LanceDB, Weaviate, MinIO, or RDBMS).
   * Abstract away details of connection pools, client libraries, and authentication.

2. **Backend Selection & Failover**

   * Monitor data volume in Chroma; if total stored embeddings exceed a configured threshold (e.g., 10 GB), automatically migrate or route new writes to LanceDB, maintaining a "Chroma primary, LanceDB fallback" policy.
   * Track Chroma query‐recall metrics (e.g., percentage of relevant hits); if recall falls below a threshold (e.g., 0.3 cosine), temporarily route search queries to Weaviate until Chroma is retrained or reindexed.

3. **CRUD Operations for Embeddings & Metadata**

   * **StoreEmbedding**: Persist a high‐dimensional vector plus metadata (ID, timestamps, tags) into the chosen vector store.
   * **QueryVectors**: Accept a query embedding, execute nearest‐neighbor search, and return matching IDs with similarity scores and provenance.
   * **UpsertMetadata**: Save or update structured metadata (e.g., episode info) in the RDBMS, enabling transactional consistency and relational queries.

4. **Document & Blob Storage**

   * **storeDocument**: Accept raw text, JSON, or binary content (e.g., logs, configuration files) and index it in Weaviate (for semantic search) and—if needed—in RDBMS (for structured queries).
   * **storeBlob**: Upload large binary objects (e.g., audio recordings, user‐uploaded files) to MinIO (S3‐compatible), returning a stable URL or key for retrieval.
   * Ensure versioning or content‐hashing to avoid duplication and support idempotent writes.

5. **Health Checks & Monitoring**

   * Expose methods to check connectivity and basic sanity (e.g., `pingChroma()`, `pingLanceDB()`, `pingWeaviate()`, `pingMinIO()`, `pingRDBMS()`).
   * Emit health metrics (latency, error counts) for each backend to ObservabilityAdapter so that ReflexionEngine or administrators can detect problems.

6. **Schema Migrations & Index Maintenance**
   * Manage schema versions for RDBMS tables (e.g., using a migration tool) to support evolving metadata fields.
   * Schedule or trigger reindexing jobs for Chroma and Weaviate when underlying data changes (e.g., after large bulk loads or migrations).

***

## 2. Inputs & Outputs

### 2.1 Inputs

1. **Embedding Data**

   * **Vectors**: Float32 arrays (length depends on embedding model).
   * **Metadata**: Key‐value pairs containing `id`, `projectID`, `timestamp`, `modelUsed`, `tags`.

2. **Text Documents & JSON Objects**

   * Raw strings (code snippets, documentation paragraphs) or serialized JSON objects.
   * Metadata such as `documentID`, `sourcePath`, `language`, `lastModified`.

3. **Binary Blobs**

   * Arbitrary binary streams (e.g., images, audio, large logs), accompanied by metadata: `blobID`, `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `uploadTimestamp`.

4. **Query Requests**

   * **Vector Queries**: Query vector plus optional filters (e.g., `projectID`, `tags`, `minSimilarity`).
   * **Text Queries**: Keyword‐based search parameters or RAG‐style retrieve calls to Weaviate.
   * **Metadata Queries**: SQL‐like filters against RDBMS (e.g., "fetch episodes where `modelUsed = 'starcoder2' AND timestamp > X`").
   * **Blob Retrieval**: Request by `blobID` or URL.

5. **Configuration Settings**
   * `chromaMaxSizeGB`: Maximum data volume before switching to LanceDB (e.g., 10 GB).
   * `chromaRecallThreshold`: Cosine recall threshold to fallback to Weaviate (e.g., 0.3).
   * Connection parameters: host, port, credentials for each backend.
   * Paths for local LanceDB storage or Docker Compose settings for Weaviate and MinIO.

### 2.2 Outputs

1. **Query Results**

   * **Vector Search**: Array of `(id, similarityScore, metadata)` tuples sorted by score.
   * **Document Search**: Array of `(documentID, snippet, score, metadata)` from Weaviate.
   * **Metadata Query**: List of structured records (rows) matching filters.
   * **Blob Fetch**: Stream or signed URL to the binary asset.

2. **Operation Acknowledgments**

   * For writes (embeddings, documents, blobs, metadata), return a success object:

     ```json
     {
       "status": "OK",
       "id": "<newItemID>",
       "backend": "Chroma" | "LanceDB" | "Weaviate" | "MinIO" | "RDBMS"
     }
     ```

   * On failure, standardized error object with `errorCode`, `message`, and optional `retryable: boolean`.

3. **Health Check Responses**

   * Boolean or structured reply indicating connectivity status and basic metrics (e.g., `{"chroma": true, "spark": false, "latencyMs": {...}}`).

4. **Migration & Reindexing Reports**
   * After a migration or reindex, return a summary: number of items migrated, errors encountered, time taken.

***

## 3. Data Structures

### 3.1 EmbeddingEntry

```ts
interface EmbeddingEntry {
  id: string;                  // Unique identifier (e.g., "projA_T012_20250620T143000")
  vector: number[];            // Float32 embedding of length D
  metadata: {
    projectID: string;
    modelUsed: string;
    timestamp: string;         // ISO-8601
    tags?: string[];           // Optional categorization
    additional?: Record<string, any>;
  };
}

 • id: Should be globally unique.
 • vector: Stored in Chroma or LanceDB.
 • metadata: Stored alongside in the vector store and redundantly in RDBMS for complex queries.

3.2 DocumentEntry

interface DocumentEntry {
  documentID: string;          // e.g., "doc-12345"
  content: string;             // Raw text or JSON string
  metadata: {
    sourcePath: string;        // Path or logical key
    language: string;          // e.g., "markdown", "javascript"
    lastModified: string;      // ISO-8601
    projectID?: string;
    tags?: string[];
  };
}

 • Persisted in Weaviate (for semantic search) and optionally in RDBMS for metadata lookups.

3.3 BlobEntry

interface BlobEntry {
  blobID: string;              // e.g., "blob-abcdef1234"
  contentType: string;         // MIME type (e.g., "application/pdf")
  sizeBytes: number;
  storageKey: string;          // MinIO key or S3‐style path
  metadata: {
    uploadedAt: string;        // ISO-8601
    uploaderID?: string;
    projectID?: string;
    tags?: string[];
  };
}

 • Actual bytes stored in MinIO; references and metadata stored in RDBMS.

3.4 MetadataRecord

interface MetadataRecord {
  table: string;               // Data domain (e.g., "episodes", "tasks")
  recordID: string;            // Primary key
  fields: Record<string, any>; // Column‐value map (e.g., {"taskID":"T001","status":"done"})
}

 • Serialized into RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL). Supports complex joins and transactional operations.

4. Algorithms & Workflow

4.1 Backend Initialization
 1. Load Configuration
 • Read storageAdapter settings from ~/.nootropic/config.json.
 • Expand environment variables and validate required fields (e.g., hostnames, credentials).
 2. Connect to Chroma
 • Instantiate Chroma client with provided endpoint.
 • Query Chroma for collectionSizeGB; compare with chromaMaxSizeGB.
 • If below threshold, mark Chroma as "primary" for vector writes; otherwise, flag for redirect to LanceDB (see 4.3).
 3. Connect to LanceDB (if configured)
 • Initialize LanceDB storage at configured path.
 • Ensure schema for EmbeddingEntry is registered.
 4. Connect to Weaviate
 • Create Weaviate client pointing to weaviateHost:port.
 • Verify schema for DocumentEntry class exists; create if missing.
 5. Connect to MinIO
 • Instantiate MinIO client with S3 credentials.
 • Check that the configured bucket exists; create if not.
 6. Connect to RDBMS
 • Use an ORM (e.g., TypeORM or Knex) to connect to the relational database.
 • Run pending migrations to ensure MetadataRecord tables and BlobEntry references exist.
 7. Health Check Cache
 • Perform a quick "ping" (e.g., simple query) on each backend to verify connectivity.
 • Cache health statuses with a short TTL (e.g., 30 seconds) to avoid repeated checks on every operation.

4.2 Storing Embeddings
 1. Receive EmbeddingEntry
 • Validate vector dimensionality matches expected model output.
 • Normalize or compress vector if needed (e.g., using 16‐bit quantization for LanceDB).
 2. Route to Backend
 • If Chroma is marked "primary":
 • Call chromaClient.addDocument({ id, vector, metadata }).
 • If Chroma returns an error indicating "out of space" or "exceeds limit," mark Chroma as "full" and reroute to LanceDB.
 • If LanceDB is "fallback" or Chroma is full:
 • Insert into LanceDB table: lanceDB.insert({ id, vector, metadata }).
 3. RDBMS Synchronization
 • Insert or update corresponding MetadataRecord in RDBMS table embeddings_metadata for relational queries.
 • Use a transaction to guarantee atomicity between vector store and RDBMS.
 4. Emit OTEL Spans & Metrics
 • Span: storageAdapter.storeEmbedding with attributes: backendUsed, vectorSize, projectID.
 • Counter: storageAdapter.embeddingsStored_total increment.

4.3 Querying Vectors
 1. Check Chroma Health & Recall
 • If Chroma's data volume < chromaMaxSizeGB and recent recall ≥ chromaRecallThreshold, route to Chroma; else, use Weaviate's hybrid search (dense mode) or LanceDB.
 • Optionally, perform a small "recall test" by comparing known vectors; if performance is poor, switch to Weaviate.
 2. Chroma Query Path
 • Call chromaClient.query({ queryEmbedding, nResults, filters: metadataFilters }).
 • Return list of (id, score, metadata).
 3. LanceDB Query Path (if Chroma unavailable or full)
 • Call lanceDB.knnSearch("embeddings_table", queryEmbedding, k=nResults).
 • Return matching records along with metadata.
 4. Weaviate Dense‐Hybrid Query (fallback)
 • Build a Weaviate GraphQL request for nearVector: {vector: [...] , certainty: minThreshold} plus filters.
 • Return top results with _additional { vectorDistance } and metadata.
 5. Provenance & Merge
 • Regardless of backend, annotate each result with provenance: "Chroma" | "LanceDB" | "Weaviate".
 • Map each id to its full EmbeddingEntry.metadata from RDBMS if deeper context is needed.
 6. Emit Metrics
 • Span: storageAdapter.queryVectors with attributes: backendUsed, numResultsRequested, numResultsReturned, latencyMs.
 • Counter: storageAdapter.vectorQueries_total.

4.4 Storing & Retrieving Documents
 1. storeDocument(DocumentEntry)
 • Validate content length; optionally split large documents into smaller chunks if beyond Weaviate's size limit.
 • Upsert into Weaviate: Map DocumentEntry fields to a Weaviate class (e.g., Document).
 • Insert/Update corresponding MetadataRecord in RDBMS for faster lookup (e.g., to find all docs modified after a given date).
 2. fetchDocument(documentID)
 • Query RDBMS for sourcePath and verify existence.
 • If needed, fetch full content from Weaviate (if stored as text) or read from filesystem (if referenced).
 • Return DocumentEntry with metadata.
 3. Document Search Integration
 • When SearchAgent requests text retrieval, StorageAdapter can forward to Weaviate's GraphQL or REST interface.
 4. Emit Metrics
 • Span: storageAdapter.storeDocument, attributes: documentID, sizeBytes, language.
 • Span: storageAdapter.fetchDocument, attributes: documentID, latencyMs.

4.5 Storing & Retrieving Blobs
 1. storeBlob(BlobEntry, ReadableStream)
 • Compute a content‐hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the incoming stream for deduplication; if a blob with that hash already exists in MinIO, skip upload and return existing blobID.
 • Upload stream to MinIO bucket under key shasum or blobID.
 • Insert BlobEntry into RDBMS table blobs (columns: blobID, storageKey, contentType, sizeBytes, uploadedAt, tags).
 • Return blobID and a pre-signed URL or short‐lived token for retrieval.
 2. fetchBlob(blobID)
 • Query RDBMS to retrieve storageKey and contentType.
 • Generate a pre‐signed URL (with TTL) from MinIO client and return it, or stream bytes directly through the StorageAdapter API.
 3. Emit Metrics
 • Span: storageAdapter.storeBlob, attributes: blobID, sizeBytes, latencyMs.
 • Span: storageAdapter.fetchBlob, attributes: blobID, latencyMs.

4.6 Metadata CRUD
 1. upsertMetadata(MetadataRecord)
 • Execute INSERT … ON CONFLICT UPDATE … in RDBMS to ensure record is created or modified atomically.
 • Optionally, emit a "change feed" event (via ReflexionAdapter) so other components can react to metadata updates.
 2. queryMetadata(table, filters, pagination)
 • Build dynamic SQL query based on filter parameters (e.g., WHERE projectID = ? AND timestamp > ?).
 • Support pagination via LIMIT/OFFSET or keyset pagination.
 • Return matching rows as JSON objects.
 3. deleteMetadata(table, recordID)
 • Remove the row from RDBMS; if cascade is required (e.g., delete related vector entries), schedule a cleanup job:
 • Delete from Chroma/LanceDB where id = recordID.
 • Delete from Weaviate (if document).
 • Emit cleanup metrics.
 4. Emit Metrics
 • Span: storageAdapter.upsertMetadata, attributes: table, recordID, latencyMs.
 • Span: storageAdapter.queryMetadata, attributes: table, filtersApplied, resultsCount.

5. Integration Points
 1. SearchAgent
 • Relies on queryVectors (Chroma/LanceDB/Weaviate) and storeDocument for indexing new files.
 • If Chroma recall is low, StorageAdapter transparently redirects to Weaviate.
 2. MemoryAgent
 • Uses storeEmbedding to persist episodic vectors.
 • Queries via queryVectors to retrieve similar episodes.
 3. CriticAgent
 • Stores static‐analysis results and code‐quality metadata in RDBMS via upsertMetadata.
 • May store large logs or rule definitions as documents in Weaviate.
 4. PluginLoaderAdapter
 • Plugins that need to persist custom data (e.g., plugin configurations) can call into StorageAdapter's generic storeDocument or upsertMetadata.
 5. ObservabilityAdapter
 • Instruments all StorageAdapter methods, emitting OTEL spans and metrics.
 • Alerts if any backend's latency or error rate exceeds thresholds (e.g., Chroma queries consistently timing out).
 6. ProjectMgrAgent
 • Queries metadata (e.g., all episodes older than X) via queryMetadata.
 • On project closure, can request fetchBlob URLs to retrieve archived logs.
 7. Temporal Workflows
 • Embedding and indexing tasks can be implemented as Temporal activities; the StorageAdapter methods are called from within those activities to ensure durability and retries on failure.

These metrics feed into dashboards and alerting rules, enabling rapid detection of storage degradation (e.g., Chroma full, Weaviate unreachable, MinIO latency spikes).

⸻

8. Testing & Validation

8.1 Unit Tests
 1. Chroma vs. LanceDB Routing
 • Simulate inserting embeddings until the reported Chroma size exceeds chromaMaxSizeGB.
 • Verify that subsequent storeEmbedding calls route to LanceDB instead of Chroma.
 2. Weaviate Fallback
 • Mock Chroma's recall metric to be below chromaRecallThreshold.
 • Perform a queryVectors and assert that the call goes to Weaviate (using a stub client) instead of Chroma.
 3. Blob Deduplication
 • Upload the same binary content twice; verify second call returns existing blobID without re-uploading.
 • Simulate a partial upload failure and ensure retry logic works as configured.
 4. Metadata Upsert & Deletion
 • Insert a MetadataRecord into RDBMS, then update one of its fields; verify that the record is updated, not duplicated.
 • Delete a record and confirm that associated vector entries (in Chroma/LanceDB) are removed if cascade enabled.
 5. Health Check Responses
 • Mock each backend to be unreachable; assert that pingChroma(), pingWeaviate(), etc. return false and do not throw uncaught exceptions.

8.2 Integration Tests
 1. Chroma + LanceDB End‐to‐End
 • Stand up a Chroma server and a local LanceDB directory.
 • Insert 12 GB worth of synthetic embeddings (e.g., random vectors) into Chroma; verify that once the threshold is hit, further writes go to LanceDB.
 • Query for a known vector; if it resides in LanceDB, confirm it is still retrievable.
 2. Weaviate Semantic Search
 • Deploy Weaviate via Docker Compose with a Document class.
 • Insert sample documents (e.g., README files).
 • Run a semantic query via StorageAdapter; verify that relevant documents are returned in the correct order.
 3. MinIO Blob Lifecycle
 • Start a local MinIO container.
 • Upload a 5 MB binary via storeBlob; verify file appears in MinIO bucket.
 • Fetch the blob via fetchBlob; confirm content matches the original.
 • Delete the entry in RDBMS and ensure the blob remains (or is cleaned up if cascade policy specified).
 4. RDBMS Transactional Consistency
 • In a failing upsert scenario (e.g., RDBMS offline), confirm that vector writes to Chroma or LanceDB roll back or are handled so that no orphan vectors remain.
 • Use a temporary table to simulate failure and verify atomicity.
 5. Schema Migration
 • Start with older RDBMS schema; run StorageAdapter startup.
 • Confirm pending migrations apply (e.g., new columns added, indexes created) and data is preserved.

8.3 End‐to‐End Stress Tests
 1. Heavy Write Load
 • Simulate 100 concurrent storeEmbedding calls with 1,000-dimensional vectors.
 • Measure p95 write latency; target < 200 ms per write on a typical dev machine with local Chroma.
 2. High‐Volume Search
 • Insert 1 million embeddings across Chroma/LanceDB.
 • Run 100 concurrent queryVectors requests; measure p95 query latency, target < 100 ms for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) index.
 3. Mixed Workload
 • Simultaneously run 50 vector writes, 50 vector queries, 20 document writes, and 20 blob uploads.
 • Ensure no deadlocks, and average latency remains within acceptable SLAs.

⸻

9. Edge Cases & Failure Modes
 1. Chroma Out of Space / Index Corruption
 • If Chroma reports "out of space" or its index files become corrupted:
 • Automatically mark Chroma as "disabled," reroute writes to LanceDB, and emit an alert via ObservabilityAdapter.
 • Attempt to schedule a background Chroma reindex if disk space is freed.
 2. Weaviate Container Crash
 • If Weaviate becomes unreachable (e.g., Docker container stops), fallback to pure dense search in Chroma or LanceDB for semantic queries.
 • Retry Weaviate connection at a backoff interval; once healthy, resume hybrid search.
 3. MinIO Bucket Not Found / Permission Denied
 • If MinIO bucket does not exist or access is denied on upload:
 • Retry with exponential backoff (up to maxRetries).
 • If still failing, insert a "failedBlob" record in RDBMS with retryable=false and return an error to caller.
 4. RDBMS Deadlocks / Connection Pool Exhaustion
 • Use ORM's built‐in retry mechanisms for common transient failures.
 • If pool is exhausted, queue write requests into a temporary backlog (in memory) and process as connections free up; emit storageAdapter.rdbmsBacklogSize metric.
 5. Network Partition
 • In distributed setups, network partitions may isolate the StorageAdapter from remote backends.
 • Gracefully degrade: return serviceUnavailable errors to downstream agents, provide stale data if cached, and begin health check polling to detect recovery.
 6. Time Skew in Timestamps
 • If system clocks differ between StorageAdapter and backend (e.g., Weaviate server), comparison of lastModified may behave incorrectly.
 • Mitigation: enforce use of a UTC‐normalized time source and, if possible, use monotonic counters or rely on backend‐assigned timestamps.

⸻

10. Future Enhancements
 1. Automatic Sharding & Shard Rebalancing
 • When data grows beyond a certain scale, automatically shard Chroma collections or distribute LanceDB shards across multiple nodes.
 • Implement rebalancing logic to evenly distribute embeddings.
 2. Multi‐Region Replication
 • For global deployments, add replication of vector and document indices across regions (e.g., Chroma clusters or Weaviate replicas) to reduce latency and improve resilience.
 3. Advanced Deduplication & Pruning
 • Periodically scan embedding indices for near‐duplicate vectors (cosine similarity > 0.99) and prune older entries or merge metadata, reducing storage costs.
 4. Encrypted Storage & Access Control
 • Integrate encryption‐at‐rest for LanceDB files, Weaviate attachments, and MinIO buckets.
 • Add fine‐grained RBAC for RDBMS tables and object buckets.
 5. Policy‐Driven Data Retention
 • Allow configuration of data retention policies (e.g., "delete embeddings older than 180 days" or "move archived vectors to cold storage").
 • Automate archiving tasks to a cheaper storage tier (e.g., write to an object store).
 6. Graph Database Integration
 • Incorporate a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store relationships between embeddings, documents, and metadata (e.g., "which episode references which code file") to support richer queries.
 7. Plugin Support for Custom Backends
 • Via PluginLoaderAdapter, allow third‐party adapters for new storage backends (e.g., Hybrid‐FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone).
 • Abstract the backend interface so that plugins can register their own VectorStore or DocumentStore implementations.
 8. Optimistic Concurrency & Conflict Resolution
 • Implement version‐stamping on metadata records; allow simultaneous updates with conflict detection and merge strategies (e.g., last‐write‐wins or custom merge hooks).

⸻

11. Summary

The StorageAdapter is a foundational component in nootropic's architecture, providing a resilient, extensible, and unified interface for vector, document, metadata, and blob storage across multiple backends. It manages dynamic backend selection—automatically routing between Chroma, LanceDB, and Weaviate based on data volume and recall metrics—while offering robust failover to MinIO and RDBMS for binary assets and structured data. Health checks, schema migrations, and transaction safeguards ensure consistency and high availability. Comprehensive instrumentation via ObservabilityAdapter provides real‐time insight into storage performance and error conditions. Through caching, retry policies, and intelligent routing, StorageAdapter delivers both high performance and reliability, allowing downstream agents (SearchAgent, MemoryAgent, CriticAgent, etc.) to operate without needing to know the details of underlying storage systems. Future enhancements promise even greater scalability, security, and flexibility, cementing StorageAdapter's role as the durable persistence backbone of nootropic's free‐first AI development ecosystem.
