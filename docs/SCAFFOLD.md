# Summary

This document provides a clear, step‐by‐step technical roadmap and scaffolding plan for building nootropic—an AI/LLM‐driven, free/OSS‐first development environment and VS Code plugin. It begins with an overview of project goals, core architecture, and high‐level dependencies, then details how to bootstrap the repository, configure CI/CD, and establish coding standards. It also covers onboarding new developers, implementing primary agents and adapters, testing strategies, release processes, and contribution guidelines. Throughout, best practices for open‐source project management, documentation, and developer workflows are referenced to ensure consistency, quality, and a contributor‐friendly experience. Key aspects include:

* **Project Initialization & Repository Structure:** Creating a monorepo, defining packages and extensions, and setting up version control with Git (DVCS).
* **Agent & Adapter Implementation Order:** Prioritizing critical components (ProjectMgrAgent, ModelAdapter, SearchAgent, CoderAgent, CriticAgent, MemoryAgent, ReflexionAdapter) in iterative phases, aligned with v1.0, v1.1, etc.
* **Scaffolding & Developer Workflow:** Automated project scaffolding using templates (e.g., Yeoman, Cookiecutter), pre‐commit hooks for lint/tests, and clear branching conventions.
* **Documentation & Developer Guide:** Writing a thorough README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT, and component‐level docs, leveraging examples and tutorials to accelerate onboarding.
* **CI/CD & Quality Gates:** Enforcing linting, unit/integration tests, SAST (Semgrep, CodeQL), dependency scans, and coverage thresholds; optimizing test execution order and caching.
* **Release & Versioning:** Adopting SemVer, automated changelog generation, GitHub/GitLab workflows for tagging, and packaging CLI/Electron/VS Code extensions.
* **Community & Contribution:** Establishing issue templates, roadmap visibility, coding standards, and plugin SDK guidelines to foster contributions and plugin ecosystem growth.

1. Introduction & Project Goals

2. Vision & Scope
   • nootropic aims to deliver a self-healing, AI/LLM-driven development environment that integrates planning, coding, testing, and deployment into a cohesive workflow. It is designed to be free‐first, open‐source, and extensible, supporting local LLM inference (e.g., StarCoder, CodeLlama via Ollama, LM Studio) and opt-in cloud services (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
   • The initial release (v1.x) will focus on a monorepo architecture with core agents (ProjectMgrAgent, CoderAgent, CriticAgent, MemoryAgent, PlannerAgent), adapters (ModelAdapter, SearchAgent, StorageAdapter, ReflexionAdapter), a VS Code extension (Continue-based), and an Electron dashboard.

3. High-Level Objectives
   • Seamless UX: Provide a unified interface (VS Code, CLI, Electron) so developers can plan, code, test, and deploy without context switching.
   • Privacy & Data Sovereignty: By default, all code, embeddings, and telemetry stay local. Users explicitly opt into cloud backends.
   • Modularity & Extensibility: Each component is a stateless micro‐service or plugin (gRPC/event bus contracts), allowing hot-swap, horizontal scaling, and community extensions.
   • Self-Healing & Reflexion: Implement continuous feedback loops (e.g., ReflexionAdapter events, CriticAgent auto-patches) to detect regressions, rerun tests, and fine-tune models nightly.

4. Key Stakeholders & Contributors
   • Core Maintainers: Responsible for agent core logic, CLI, and documentation.
   • Plugin Authors: Will use the PluginLoaderAdapter to extend functionality (e.g., custom lint rules, integrations).
   • Community Members: Report issues, submit PRs, write tutorials, and review code.

5. Repository & Monorepo Scaffolding

2.1 Monorepo Structure

Organize nootropic as a monorepo using npm workspaces, Yarn Berry, or PnP, enabling shared dependencies and consistent versioning. For example:

/nootropic
├── packages/
│ ├── projectmgr-agent/ # ProjectMgrAgent core logic
│ ├── coder-agent/ # CoderAgent (patch generation)
│ ├── critic-agent/ # CriticAgent (static analysis, tests)
│ ├── memory-agent/ # MemoryAgent (Chroma embeddings)
│ ├── planner-agent/ # PlannerAgent (PDDL planning)
│ ├── reasoning-agent/ # ReasoningAgent (LATS + reflexion)
│ ├── search-agent/ # SearchAgent (Chroma + Weaviate)
│ ├── storage-adapter/ # StorageAdapter (Chroma/LanceDB/Weaviate/MinIO/RDBMS)
│ ├── model-adapter/ # ModelAdapter (LLM inference routing)
│ ├── reflexion-adapter/ # ReflexionAdapter (event bus)
│ └── plugin-loader-adapter/ # PluginLoaderAdapter (hot-reload plugins)
├── extensions/
│ ├── vscode-extension/ # VS Code (Continue-based) extension
│ └── electron-dashboard/ # Electron dashboard UI
├── scripts/ # Utility scripts (e.g., codegen, release helpers)
├── docs/ # All project documentation (README, GETTING-STARTED, etc.)
├── .github/ # CI/CD workflows, issue/PR templates
├── package.json # Root package (workspaces)
├── tsconfig.json # Shared TypeScript config
└── README.md # Root-level overview and quickstart

• Each package and extension has its own package.json with dependencies and build scripts.
• Use a common ESLint and Prettier config at the root to enforce consistent code formatting across all packages.
• Adopt TypeScript for all code to benefit from static typing; include strict lint rules (e.g., strictNullChecks, noImplicitAny) to catch errors early.

2.2 Initial Bootstrap Steps

1. Initialize Git & Remote Repository
   • Create a new Git repository (e.g., on GitHub) and clone it locally:

git init nootropic
cd nootropic
git remote add origin <git@github.com>:your-org/nootropic.git

• Add a .gitignore configured for Node, TypeScript, and typical IDE files.

2. Set Up Root package.json
   • Define workspaces (e.g., "workspaces": \["packages/*", "extensions/*"]).
   • Configure root scripts for bootstrapping, linting, building, and testing all workspaces:

{
"private": true,
"workspaces": \["packages/*", "extensions/*"],
"scripts": {
"bootstrap": "npm install",
"build": "npm run build --workspaces",
"lint": "npm run lint --workspaces",
"test": "npm run test --workspaces"
},
"devDependencies": {
"eslint": "^8.0.0",
"prettier": "^2.0.0",
"typescript": "^4.0.0"
}
}

3. Configure TypeScript & ESLint
   • Create a tsconfig.json at the root with base settings (compilerOptions, include, exclude).
   • Add .eslintrc.js with common rules and extend recommended configs (e.g., eslint:recommended, plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended).

4. Add Essential Documentation Files
   • README.md: Provide a high-level overview, links to docs, basic setup.
   • CONTRIBUTING.md: Outline how to contribute, code style, commit conventions, and PR process.
   • CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md: Adopt a standard Code of Conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant) to promote respectful community interactions.
   • LICENSE: Choose a permissive OSS license (e.g., Apache 2.0 or MIT) to align with free-first philosophy.
   • .github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE.md and .github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE.md: Provide reproducible issue templates (e.g., bug, feature request) to standardize contributions.

5. Set Up Continuous Integration (CI)
   • Use GitHub Actions with a matrix strategy to run on Linux/macOS/Windows. Include jobs for:
   • Lint: npm run lint (fail fast).
   • Build: npm run build (TypeScript compilation).
   • Unit & Integration Tests: npm run test (parallel across packages).
   • SAST & Dependency Scans: Integrate Semgrep and Dependabot to catch vulnerabilities early.
   • Configure branch protection rules to require passing CI on main or develop branches.

6. Development Workflow & Scaffolding

3.1 Scaffolding a New Project

For v1.x, create a scaffold CLI command that uses Cookiecutter or Yeoman to generate a new project skeleton based on a user‐provided spec (e.g., project‐spec.yaml):

1. Project Specification
   • Define a project‐spec.yaml with fields such as projectName, language, framework, dependencies, and CIPreferences.
   • Example:

projectName: "awesome-app"
language: "typescript"
framework: "express"
dependencies:

* "typescript"
* "express"
* "jsonwebtoken"
  ci:
  provider: "github"
  tests: \["jest", "eslint"]
  projectType: "web-service"

2. Cookiecutter Template
   • Under docs/SCAFFOLD.md, document how to implement a template with placeholders (e.g., {{projectName}} in package.json, README.md).
   • CLI invocation:

npx nootropic scaffold project-spec.yaml --ci github --language ts

3. Scaffolded Output
   • Generates a new folder awesome-app/ containing:

/awesome-app
├── src/
│ ├── index.ts
│ └── ...
├── tests/
├── .eslintrc.js
├── jest.config.js
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
└── README.md

• Automatically sets up CI config (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml) based on ci.provider.

Scaffolding best practices: focus on minimal initial setup so users can get started quickly, display clear TODOs, and ensure generated code passes lint/tests by default.

3.2 Branching & Git Strategy

1. Git Flow / Trunk‐Based Development
   • Adopt GitHub Flow: all changes happen in short‐lived feature branches branched from main, and are merged via PRs.
   • Enforce that main is always deployable: require CI passing and at least one code review.
2. Commit Message Conventions
   • Use Conventional Commits format (type(scope): description) for automated changelog generation and semantic versioning.
   • Example:

feat(coder-agent): add support for dry-run code generation
fix(cli): correct plugin:install help text
docs: update CONTRIBUTING guidelines

3. Pull Requests (PRs)
   • Include a description template requiring:
   • What change is being made (brief summary).
   • Why this change is needed (issue link, user story).
   • How to test (instructions to reproduce, expected behavior).
   • Assign reviewers automatically based on code‐owner rules (CODEOWNERS file under .github/).

4. Core Components Implementation Plan

4.1 Phase 1: Foundational Agents (v1.0)

1. ProjectMgrAgent
   • Responsibilities: Parse project-spec.md / YAML, build a PDDL domain/problem, invoke a solver (e.g., Fast‐Downward), and emit a TaskGraph.json.
   • Implementation Steps:
2. Design project-spec.yaml schema (epics, stories, dependencies, labels).
3. Write a parser in TypeScript that outputs PDDL domain/problem files.
4. Integrate a PDDL solver binary via CLI or Docker (e.g., Fast‐Downward) using child processes.
5. Capture solver output and generate a JSON DAG of tasks with metadata (e.g., id, description, preconditions, duration).
6. Expose a CLI command: npx nootropic plan \[--delta] \[--timeout <secs>].
   • Tests:
   • Unit tests for PDDL translation logic (parser → domain) using sample YAMLs.
   • Integration test: invoke solver on small specs, validate TaskGraph JSON matches expected.
7. ModelAdapter
   • Responsibilities: Abstract LLM inference across local (Ollama, LM Studio) and cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic). Provide a unified infer() and embed() interface.
   • Implementation Steps:
8. Define a configuration schema (~/.nootropic/config.json) for local and cloud credentials.
9. Implement local inference via Ollama's REST API or CLI (e.g., ollama run starcoder2).
10. Implement cloud inference using official SDKs (e.g., OpenAI's openai npm package).
11. Write an LRU cache for embeddings to reduce repeated calls.
12. Expose async functions:
    • infer(messages: ChatCompletionRequest, options) → ChatCompletionResponse
    • embed(inputs: string\[], options) → float\[]\[]
    • Tests:
    • Mock local inference to return known responses; verify CLI invocation.
    • Mock cloud API to simulate rate limits and fallback behavior.
13. SearchAgent
    • Responsibilities: Index project files into Chroma (vector) and Weaviate (sparse); handle hybrid RAG queries.
    • Implementation Steps:
14. Configure Chroma via Docker Compose or local binary; define a vector collection schema.
15. Configure Weaviate similarly with a Document class.
16. Implement a filesystem watcher (e.g., chokidar) to detect changes under src/, docs/, tests/.
17. Chunk files (via token count or AST boundaries), compute embeddings (ModelAdapter.embed()), and upsert into Chroma and Weaviate.
18. Build the search(query, filters) API: compute query embedding, query both backends, merge + deduplicate results, and rerank.
19. Expose npx nootropic search "..." --lang js --limit 10.
    • Tests:
    • Unit test chunking logic on sample files.
    • Integration test: index a small repo, run queries, verify expected snippets returned.
20. CoderAgent
    • Responsibilities: Given a <task-id> and context (e.g., file paths, CriticAgent issues), generate code patches via LLM and hand off to CoderAgent.
    • Implementation Steps:
21. Fetch task details from TaskGraph.json (e.g., files to modify, description).
22. Collect relevant context: snippets from SearchAgent (e.g., around the target function) and CriticAgent feedback.
23. Construct a CoT prompt instructing the LLM to propose patches (e.g., "Fix SQL injection in getUserByID).
24. Call ModelAdapter.infer() to generate unified‐diff style patch or instructions.
25. If --dry-run: print patch to console; if --apply: call git apply --check then git apply, create a commit with a standardized message.
    • Tests:
    • Unit test prompt‐construction on sample tasks.
    • Integration: simulate a simple bug, run npx nootropic code T001 --apply, confirm patch fixes bug and tests pass.
26. CriticAgent
    • Responsibilities: Perform static analysis (Semgrep, OpenRewrite) and run test suites. Provide structured reports for CoderAgent and ReasoningAgent.
    • Implementation Steps:
27. Integrate Semgrep (OSS) for on‐the‐fly SAST: configure rules (OWASP Top 10, custom best practices) and auto-patch with semgrep-autofix where possible.
28. Integrate OpenRewrite for language‐specific refactors (e.g., Java/C#).
29. Implement test runner abstraction: detect project type (npm, pytest, JUnit) and execute tests, capturing pass/fail and coverage.
30. Expose a function analyzeCode(files: string\[]): CriticReport that returns issues and test outcomes.
    • Tests:
    • Unit: validate that known vulnerable patterns (e.g., hardcoded credentials) are flagged.
    • Integration: introduce a deliberate SQL injection in example code, verify CriticAgent catches it.
31. MemoryAgent
    • Responsibilities: Store and retrieve "episodes" (prompts, responses, user feedback) in a vector database (Chroma) for few-shot context in future tasks.
    • Implementation Steps:
32. Define an episode schema (id, prompt, response, feedback, timestamp) and embed text via ModelAdapter.embed().
33. Store embeddings + metadata in Chroma (or LanceDB fallback).
34. Provide remember(prompt: string, response: string) and recall(query: string): Episode\[] APIs.
35. Hook into CoderAgent and ReasoningAgent to log accepted diffs and feedback.
    • Tests:
    • Unit: generate two distinct episodes, verify recall returns the correct episode given a related query.
    • Integration: pipeline with CoderAgent → MemoryAgent → subsequent task, confirm that memory improves prompt.
36. PlannerAgent
    • Responsibilities: Coordinate high-level planning (e.g., sprint assignment, resource estimation) by consuming TaskGraph from ProjectMgrAgent and interacting with CoderAgent, CriticAgent, and ReasoningAgent for scheduling.
    • Implementation Steps:
37. Read TaskGraph.json and extract tasks with metadata (estimatedEffort, dependencies).
38. Use Temporal or custom scheduler to assign tasks to sprints (e.g., first-come-first-serve or priority rules).
39. Emit events via ReflexionAdapter when tasks become ready or blocked.
40. Provide CLI: npx nootropic plan --delta to replan changed tasks.
    • Tests:
    • Unit: simulate tasks with dependencies of varying depths, verify planner orders them correctly.
    • Integration: create a small project, run full plan, confirm assignments respect capacity constraints.

4.2 Phase 2: UX & Extensibility (v1.1)

1. ReflexionAdapter & ExplainabilityAgent
   • Responsibilities:
   • ReflexionAdapter: Act as an event broker (EventEmitter/gRPC) to route events (ModelSwitched, PatchApplied, PlanUpdated) and allow subscribers to filter and buffer events.
   • ExplainabilityAgent: Subscribe to event streams and generate human-readable chain-of-thought logs, making them available to UI components (VS Code decorations, Electron overlays).
   • Implementation Steps:

2. Implement a bounded ring buffer for events with drop policy (e.g., "dropOldest") and persistent JSON-lines log for replay.

3. Expose subscription APIs (onEvent(type, filter)) for other agents and UI.

4. ExplainabilityAgent processes each LLM call's CoT trace, stores it, and exposes APIs for fetching logs per request.
   • Tests:
   • Unit: simulate a stream of events, verify that buffered correct size and drop counts.
   • Integration: from CoderAgent, generate a patch, check that ExplainabilityAgent's stored CoT matches.

5. PluginLoaderAdapter v1.1
   • Responsibilities: Discover and load plugin modules from plugins/, validate manifests via Zod, handle hot-reload, conflict resolution, and persist describe-registry.json.
   • Implementation Steps:

6. Define Zod schema for plugin manifests (name, version, commands, capabilities).

7. Use chokidar to watch plugins/; on add/change/unlink, call appropriate load/unload logic.

8. For each valid plugin, emit events (pluginLoaded, pluginUnloaded, pluginFailed) via ReflexionAdapter.

9. Persist all loaded plugin manifests to ~/.nootropic/describe-registry.json.
   • Tests:
   • Unit: attempt loading a plugin with invalid manifest, verify pluginFailed and no registration.
   • Integration: create a sample plugin that registers a CLI command; confirm CLI auto-completion picks it up.

10. VS Code Extension Enhancements
    • Responsibilities:
    • Add inline diagnostics for CriticAgent issues, code actions ("Apply Patch"), and a sidebar view for TaskGraph.
    • Implement multi-file refactoring via slash commands (e.g., /rewrite-file <rule-id>) integrating Roo Code-style editing.
    • Implementation Steps:

11. Use vscode-languageclient to register slash commands and diagnostics.

12. On CriticAgent analysis, convert issues to vscode.Diagnostic and attach to corresponding files.

13. For TaskGraph view, generate a TreeView in the activity bar with clickable nodes that open file and highlight task areas.
    • Tests:
    • Manual: install extension in VS Code Insiders, run /plan, observe TaskGraph in sidebar.
    • Automated: use VS Code Test Runner to simulate commands and verify proper events.

14. Electron Dashboard Enhancements
    • Responsibilities:
    • Display an interactive timeline of Reflexion events, plugin manager UI, and embedded SearchAgent for context retrieval.
    • Implementation Steps:

15. Scaffold an Electron + React app with a preload script to expose IPC channels for window.plugins and window.events.

16. Build a Timeline component that subscribes to ReflexionAdapter.onEvent and renders events chronologically, with filters.

17. Add a Plugin Manager page that calls PluginLoaderAdapter.getRegisteredPlugins() and allows enable/disable.
    • Tests:
    • Unit: mock event emitter, verify timeline state updates.
    • Integration: launch Electron, install a plugin, check that plugin appears and can be toggled.

18. Coding Standards & Best Practices

19. Language & Style
    • Adopt TypeScript (ES2020 target) for all packages to leverage static typing, clear interfaces, and early error detection.
    • Enforce ESLint + Prettier:
    • Extend eslint:recommended and plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended rules.
    • Set Prettier as the formatter with overrides for MDX, JSON, YAML.

20. Commit & Branch Conventions
    • Conventional Commits: use prefixes (feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:) to enable automated semantic versioning (via tools like semantic-release).
    • Branch Naming: feature/<component>/\<short‐description>, bugfix/<component>/\<issue‐number>.

21. Testing Guidelines
    • Unit Tests:
    • Use Jest (for TypeScript) or Mocha + Chai with ts-node for packages.
    • Aim for fast, isolated tests (< 100 ms each).
    • Integration Tests:
    • Leverage Docker Compose to spin up Chroma, Weaviate, MinIO, and run tests against them.
    • Use test fixtures (e.g., sample repo of 10–20 files) to verify indexing, search, and code patch flows.
    • End-to-End Tests:
    • Use Playwright or Cypress to test VS Code extension in a headless mode (e.g., @vscode/test).
    • Automate Electron app tests via Spectron or Playwright for Electron.

22. Static Analysis & Security
    • Integrate Semgrep (OSS) in pre-commit and CI to catch security and style issues.
    • Use CodeQL for deeper vulnerability scanning during CI; configure policies to fail on high‐severity issues.
    • Periodically run Dependency Scans (e.g., Dependabot) and review alerts for critical CVEs.

23. Documentation Standards
    • Component-Level Docs: Each core package under docs/COMPONENTS/ (e.g., ProjectMgrAgent.md, CoderAgent.md) should include:
    • Summary, responsibilities, inputs/outputs, data structures, algorithms, integration points, configuration, metrics, testing, edge cases, future enhancements.
    • API Reference: Maintain docs/API\_REFERENCE.md for REST endpoints, schemas, error codes, and examples.
    • CLI Reference: docs/CLI\_REFERENCE.md with usage, options, examples, and troubleshooting.
    • Getting Started: docs/GETTING-STARTED.md detailing environment prerequisites (Node >=16, Docker), installation, and first commands.
    • Use Markdown best practices:
    • Organize with ## and ### headings.
    • Include code blocks, screenshots, and diagrams where helpful (e.g., sequence diagram of agent interaction).
    • Embed hyperlinks to related sections and external resources (e.g., PDDL solver docs, Semgrep rules).
    • Ensure docs are searchable and easy to navigate; consider adding a sidebar or table of contents for large sections.

24. Continuous Integration & Quality Gates

6.1 CI Pipeline Design

Implement a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) with the following stages:

1. Checkout & Setup
   • Uses actions/checkout@v3 and actions/setup-node@v3 to install Node 16+.
   • Restore cached node\_modules based on package-lock.json checksum.
2. Lint & Type Check
   • Run npm run lint (ESLint) and npm run typecheck (TS compiler).
   • Fail fast if any errors; this run should take < 2 minutes.
3. Unit Tests
   • Execute npm run test:unit in all packages in parallel (matrix over packages/\*).
   • Use Jest with coverage threshold (e.g., 80%); fail build if below threshold.
4. Integration Tests
   • Spin up Docker Compose services: Chroma, Weaviate, MinIO, and a test database (SQLite).
   • Run npm run test:integration that performs RAG indexing, query, and code patch flows.
   • Tear down services after tests; total runtime target < 10 minutes.
5. Static Security Scans
   • Semgrep: semgrep --config=p/ci to check code patterns (source: Semgrep policies for Node/TS).
   • CodeQL: run github/codeql-action@v2 against the repo; record any alerts.
   • Dependency Scan: Use github/dependabot-action or Snyk to check for vulnerable packages.
6. Publish Coverage & Artifacts
   • Upload coverage reports to Codecov or SonarCloud.
   • Generate a summary with codecov/patch to comment on PRs.
7. Release Automation
   • On pushing a new tag (e.g., v1.0.0), run a separate workflow to:
   • Generate a changelog via conventional-changelog.
   • Publish packages to npm (packages that have changed).
   • Package and upload VS Code extension to the Marketplace.

6.2 CI Optimization Tips
• Fail-Fast Ordering: Place linting and type checks at the top to catch simple errors before launching heavier jobs (e.g., integration tests).
• Parallel Execution: Leverage GitHub Actions matrix to run package tests in parallel pods (max 5‐10 concurrent jobs).
• Caching Dependencies: Use actions/cache@v3 with keys based on package-lock.json.
• Test Impact Analysis: Consider running only affected package tests when changes are limited to a subset of packages (e.g., via nx or custom scripts).

7. Testing Strategy

7.1 Unit Testing
• Focus: Validate individual functions, classes, and modules in isolation.
• Tools: Jest (preferred), Mocha + Chai for packages requiring non‐Jest frameworks.
• Coverage Goals:
• Agents: 80% branch coverage on key logic (e.g., PDDL parsing, prompt construction).
• Adapters: 90% on configuration parsing and error handling.
• Utilities: 100% on helper functions (string formatting, event handling).

7.2 Integration Testing
• Focus: Verify interactions between multiple components (e.g., SearchAgent + StorageAdapter + ModelAdapter → proper RAG query).
• Environment: Docker Compose brings up Chroma, Weaviate, MinIO, SQLite.
• Sample Data: Include a test fixture repository (test-data/sample-repo/) with ~10 files in JS/TS for indexing and code patch tests.
• Test Cases:

1. Indexing Pipeline: modified file → SearchAgent reindexes → searching that term returns expected results.
2. Code Patch Flow: intentionally introduce a failing test, run npx nootropic fix-tests, verify patch fixes test and new test passes.
3. Plugin Hot-Reload: add a dummy plugin under plugins/, confirm CLI and VS Code pick it up without restart.

7.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
• Focus: Simulate real user workflows across CLI, VS Code extension, and Electron dashboard.
• Tools:
• Playwright or Cypress for CLI flows (e.g., spawn npx nootropic code T001, parse stdout).
• @vscode/test to automate VS Code integration tests (install extension, execute commands, verify editor edits).
• Spectron or Playwright for Electron for dashboard (launch Electron, simulate clicks, validate UI changes).
• Workflows:

1. New Project Creation: npx nootropic scaffold → lint/build → npx nootropic plan → open VS Code, run /plan.

2. Task Implementation: modify code, run npx nootropic code <task-id> --apply, verify patch and test pass.

3. Plugin Installation: npx nootropic plugin:install <plugin>, open Electron, verify plugin appears in UI.

4. Release & Versioning Process

5. Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
   • Follow MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format: breaking changes bump MAJOR; new features bump MINOR; bug fixes bump PATCH.
   • Use Conventional Commits to automatically generate changelogs.

6. Automated Release Workflow
   • On pushing a new Git tag (vX.Y.Z), GitHub Actions steps:

7. Validate Tag Format: ensure tag matches ^v\[0-9]+.\[0-9]+.\[0-9]+$.

8. Changelog Generation: run conventional-changelog to produce/update CHANGELOG.md.

9. Publish Packages: for each updated package (lerna changed or npm workspace diff), run npm publish --access public.

10. VS Code Extension: package via vsce and publish to Marketplace.

11. Electron App: build distributables for macOS, Windows, Linux; upload assets to GitHub Releases.
    • Draft Release Notes: populate with highlights from CHANGELOG.md and link to GitHub Issues/PRs.

12. Pre-Release & Beta Channels
    • Use vX.Y.Z-beta.N tags for beta releases; publish pre-release artifacts to npm as @nootropic/core@x.y.z-beta.n.
    • Mark VS Code extension pre-releases with a "next" channel.

13. Long-Term Support (LTS)
    • For major versions adopted by enterprises, maintain an LTS branch (e.g., v2.x‐lts) with backported critical fixes for one year.

14. Release Checklist
    • All CI checks green (lint, typecheck, tests, SAST).
    • Documentation updated (README, CHANGELOG, version references).
    • Dependencies up to date; run npm audit fix.
    • Validate binary artifacts (VS Code extension, Electron app) on target platforms.
    • Announce release on repository, Slack, mailing list, and social channels.

15. Contribution & Community Guidelines

16. Issue Triage & Labeling
    • Use GitHub labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted, good first issue).
    • Maintain a Backlog project board (kanban style) to track planned features, in-progress tasks, and blocked items.

17. Pull Request Process
    • Require that every PR:
    • Targets develop or mainline after a version cut.
    • Is linked to an open issue (via "Closes #123").
    • Passes all CI checks and includes updated tests.
    • Has at least one approval from a code owner (via CODEOWNERS file).
    • PRs that touch critical paths (agents, adapters, CLI) require at least two reviews.

18. Code Review Etiquette
    • Provide constructive, respectful feedback; focus on code, not the author.
    • Use GitHub's suggestion feature to propose inline code changes.
    • Ensure that changes align with existing architectural patterns and do not introduce unnecessary complexity.

19. Onboarding New Contributors
    • Mark "good first issue" for beginner‐friendly tasks (e.g., updating documentation, adding a simple test).
    • Maintain a mentorship program: pair new contributors with veterans for guidance on complex components.
    • Host periodic office hours via video conferencing to answer contributor questions.

20. Community Communication
    • Use a dedicated Slack or Discord workspace with channels for #random, #dev‐help, #roadmap, and #announcements.
    • Hold monthly community calls to showcase new features, gather feedback, and review roadmap progress.
    • Maintain a public roadmap file (ROADMAP.md) that is updated regularly based on community input.

21. Security & Vulnerability Reporting
    • Provide a SECURITY.md with instructions on responsibly disclosing vulnerabilities (e.g., send to <security@nootropic.ai>).
    • Triage and remedy security issues within 72 hours; bump versions and publish patches with appropriate CVE identifiers if needed.

22. Plugin Ecosystem Guidance
    • Under docs/COMPONENTS/PluginLoaderAdapter.md, document how to create, validate, and publish plugins.
    • Provide a "Plugin SDK" template under packages/plugin‐template/ with sample manifest, commands, and UI components.
    • Encourage plugin authors to adopt similar CI/CD practices: lint/test their plugin, publish to NPM, and register in the plugin registry.

23. Versioned Roadmap Overview

Refer to ROADMAP.md for detailed, time‐boxed milestones across v1.x, v2.x, and v3.x. Key highlights include:
• v1.0 (July 2025): Core agents and adapters, basic VS Code/Electron UX, first plugin SDK, documented developer guides.
• v1.1 (Q3 2025): Self-healing loops (Keptn + LitmusChaos), ExplainabilityAgent, refined plugin marketplace, multi-file refactoring.
• v2.0 (Q4 2025): Multi-IDE (Neovim, JetBrains), intelligent model matcher for quantized local inference, RAG enhancements, nightly LoRA pipeline, centralized plugin registry.
• v2.1 (Q1 2026): Enterprise features (RBAC, audit logging), Kubernetes/Helm charts, advanced search (federation, multimodal), CodeTour guides.
• v3.0 (Q3 2026): Autonomous long-horizon agents, cross-team planning, real-time collaboration, AI-driven QA, knowledge graph integration.
